## CMU Showcase Abstract

Managing cybersecurity policy to achieve Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) 2.0 is increasingly critical for businesses. The conventional approach using text documents and spreadsheets, while functional, lacks intuitiveness and fails to efficiently link policies with the necessary “evidences” for compliance. Alternatively, enterprise-scale prebuilt solutions offer a comprehensive feature set but are prohibitively expensive for small business budgets. This project proposes the development of a web app designed to bridge this gap, offering an intuitive, solution for managing cybersecurity policy. By focusing on user-friendly interfaces for managers, IT personnel, and assessors, the app aims to streamline the process of achieving and maintaining CMMC 2.0 compliance. Key features will include streamlined evidence management, revision management, and a dashboard for compliance monitoring. The expected outcome is a significant simplification of the cybersecurity management process, enabling more effective compliance and enhancing the overall security posture of businesses.
